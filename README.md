# House_Price_Prediction_Multiple_Features
Taking inspiration from `Coursera_Simple_Model_Representation` , I have decided to implement Linear Regression with multiple features instead of just one feature.

The data was randomly created, so it did not show a good linear relationship to apply `linear regression`.

I ultilized the code (with my modifications) from `Coursera` for this problem.
